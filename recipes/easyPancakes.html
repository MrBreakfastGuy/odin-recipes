    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I found this pancake recipe in my Grandma's recipe book. 
        Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this 
        was a family favorite.
    </p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>tablespoon white sugar</li> 
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li> 
    <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li> 
    <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li> 
    <li>1 egg</li> 
</ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <!--Step 1-->
        <li>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. Make a well
             in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.
            </li>
        <!--Step 2-->
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter 
            onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles 
            form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on 
            the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
        </li>
    </ol>
